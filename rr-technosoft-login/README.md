RR Technosoft — Sample Login Page

This is a small static demo login page for RR Technosoft Training Institute.

Files created:
- index.html — login form (client-side validation + demo auth)
- styles.css — basic responsive styles
- script.js — client-side logic (demo credentials)
- dashboard.html — landing page after successful demo sign-in

Demo credentials (client-side only):
- Username: student  (or student@rrtech.com)
- Password: rrtech123

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with...).
2. Enter the demo credentials and click "Sign in".

Notes:
- This is a purely front-end demo. Do NOT use client-side auth for real applications.
- Next steps: add server-side authentication, secure transport (HTTPS), and input sanitization.
